# Pacman
I created this game as a project for Object oriented programming course at my faculty, made using Visual Studio and C# programming language. The objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding ghosts that pursue him. When PacMan eats all of the dots, the player wins. If PacMan makes contact with a ghost, he loses his life; the game ends when all lives are lost. The purpose of this project was to showcase the knowledge of object oriented paradigm learnt during the course in the summer semester of 2017.
